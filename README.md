# dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles.

## Installation

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/da-n/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then use `stow` to install the dotfiles you want to use:

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow vim
stow tmux
```

## Fonts

Nerd Fonts are needed in some of the configurations. You can download Nerd Fonts from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
